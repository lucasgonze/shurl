#/bin/bash

# this is a hand-hacked way of invoking shurl
# but it requires installation of the script on the remote server
# 
# better to 
# ssh lgonze@gonze.com "bash -s" -- < ./shurl http://example.com
# 
# but then there is a bug in the configuration file generator,
# which runs remotely and needs to need from the local console.
# what should change is that the configs should be stored here, on
# the client, and passed via command line to remote instance.

# anyway, this is the old way:
ssh "$SSH_USER@$SSH_DOMAIN" $PATH_TO_SHURL_ON_WEB_SERVER "$URL_TO_SHORTEN" | tee - | pbcopy
