<p>URL shortener</p>
<p>This URL shortener is unlike the others in that there is no database, so there isn't much to break or break into. It should last longer and require less work.</p>

<p>The front end is a client-side console app which does the work of adding short URLs to the .htaccess file on your web server.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the trick is that the Apache mod_rewrite file is used to store rewrites. The privacy of your shortened URLs is protected by the fact that short URLs in this system are random strings, not serial numbers, so third parties can't spider them.</p>

<div>The entire system is contained in a single shell script, <code>shurl</code>. On first run it will create a configuration file. Edit the file to provide:
</div>

<ol>
  <li>The public URL at which your shortener will be hosted </li>
  <li>SSH address for your web server</li>
  <li>Path to .htaccess in your web server's file system</li>
  </ol>

<p>From that point on, shorten a url like this:<br>
<code>shurl [LONG URL TO SHORTEN]</code>.
  
</p>

<hr>
<p>This is designed as a client-server system where the URL is added on a client machine, then propagates to a server machine. Would it be useful to have a mode for operating within a single machine, so that the command to add a URL is invoked in a shell on the web server? Comments welcome.
